NAME
    match::simple - simplified clone of smartmatch operator

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.10;
       use match::simple;
   
       if ($this |M| $that)
       {
          say "$this matches $that";
       }

DESCRIPTION
    match::simple provides a simple match operator `|M|` that acts like a sane
    subset of the (as of Perl 5.18) deprecated smart match operator. Unlike
    smart match, the behaviour of the match is determined entirely by the
    operand on the right hand side.

    *   If the right hand side is `undef`, then there is only a match if the
        left hand side is also `undef`.

    *   If the right hand side is a non-reference, then the match is a simple
        string match.

    *   If the right hand side is a reference to a regexp, then the left hand
        is evaluated .

    *   If the right hand side is a code reference, then it is called in a
        boolean context with the left hand side being passed as an argument.

    *   If the right hand side is an object which provides a `MATCH` method,
        then it this is called as a method, with the left hand side being
        passed as an argument.

    *   If the right hand side is an object which overloads `~~`, then a true
        smart match is performed.

    *   If the right hand side is an arrayref, then the operator recurses into
        the array, with the match succeeding if the left hand side matches any
        array element.

    *   If any other value appears on the right hand side, the operator will
        croak.

    If you don't like the crazy Sub::Infix operator, you can alternatively
    export a more normal function:

       use v5.10;
       use match::simple qw(match);
   
       if (match($this, $that))
       {
          say "$this matches $that";
       }
